Customer Personality Analysis
Contains demographics (age, education, income), behavioral data (spending habits), and lifestyle indicators.
Perfect for cleaning tasks like:
Handling missing values
Standardizing text (e.g., education level)
Parsing dates
Renaming columns like "MntWines" to "wine_spending"

Mall Customer Segmentation Data
Simpler but still useful.
Contains Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, and Gender.
Good for:
Standardizing gender values
Renaming columns
Removing duplicates (if any)
Converting types

Medical Appointment No Shows
Focus: Patient attendance behavior
Not about customer traits or buying behavior
Cleaning tasks can still be practiced here (e.g., dates, missing values), but not aligned with personality analysis

Netflix Movies and TV Shows
Focus: Show metadata, not customer data
Doesnâ€™t support customer profiling or segmentation

Sales Data
Depends heavily on what's included.
If it has customer IDs, purchase history, demographics, etc., it could be adapted.
But typical public sales datasets often lack rich customer-level info for personality analysis.
