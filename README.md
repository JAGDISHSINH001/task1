Customer Personality Analysis – This dataset is directly aligned with the task. It includes customer demographic and behavioral data.
Mall Customer Segmentation Data – Also suitable, as it includes data such as age, income, and spending score, which can be used to analyze customer personality and behavior.
Medical Appointment No Shows-Focus is on predicting whether a patient shows up for a medical appointment, not customer behavior or personality.
Netflix Movies and TV Shows-Contains metadata about shows/movies, not customer data, so it’s irrelevant for personality analysis.
Sales Data-Could be useful only if it includes individual customer data (e.g., demographics, purchasing patterns).
Most generic sales datasets don’t include this level of detail, so usually not directly suitable for personality analysis.
